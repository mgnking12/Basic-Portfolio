		<p>A native Houstonian, I came to Austin about 4 years ago not having a clue what I wanted out of life. Taking a few classes at the community college that I knew wouldn't add up to a degree anytime soon, I never really did like school, I'm more of a jump right in and learn as you go type of person. As I was working at a cookie store I would play with codeacademy while I had downtime. My good friend was in a band at the time and jokingly asked me to make a webpage for them. It was quite crappy, but I did it! With how much I enjoyed the process and being able to get lost in something, I had a feeling a maybe had found a path to go on. I did some more self study and eventually went to Austin Coding Academy for their beginner course. This pretty much just jammed HTML and CSS into my head for about two months with barley dipping our toe in the water with JavaScript. I knew that only that class wouldn't get e a job, but suprisingly I landed one as a Jr. Developer at MicroMain. It is a great foot in the door, but I still haven't touched any JavaScript or really anything that I am truly passionate about. Even tho I'm not passionate persay about my work it is teaching me the basics of how the industry works, which I am grateful for, so it isn't a total loss. Now! Now obviously, I am at the coding bootcamp at UT, hoping that this will connect more dots than the last one. Also I have an awesome pitbul/boxer puppy and a pretty great boyfriend, so I don't have too many complaints about life. </p>
